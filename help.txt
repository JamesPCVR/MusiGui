DEPENDENCIES - see github for a full list

INITIAL SETUP - Pick a download folder, this is the working directory for this application, it should be seperate from anything else. Pick an upscaler folder, make sure to download at least one of the supported models listed on the github repository and place it in this directory. Its subfolder should be named "<model>-ncnn-vulkan".

HOW TO USE
- Add URLs to the text box in the bottom left, they are seperated with a newline (<enter>). The URLs can point to single streams or playlists/albums (whole playlists will be downloaded). The URLs can be from any website (e.g. youtube, soundcloud, bandcamp...) so long as it is supported by youtube-dl.
- Once you've added all the URLs you want, hit the download button in the bottom right to download the files one-by-one. The program will also download the cover art for each item.

SETTINGS
- Preferred audio quality will download the highest quality option available that is less than or equal to the selected bitrate.
- Cover art attach method "youtube-dl" will attach a unique image to each item (even within a playlist). Cover art attach method "manual select" will prompt you to select an image, this will be applied to every item in the single/playlist.
- Target image size will ensure images are exactly that size, images that are too small will be passed through an AI upscaling algorithm (more on them later). Images that are too large will be downscaled with the selected algorithm (more on them later).
- Upscale method is the AI model used to upscale images, make sure to have the models downloaded (links on the github repository).
- Downscale method sets the downscale algorithm (lanscos 8x8 gives the highest quality, nearest-neighbour is the fastest).

AI UPSCALERS
- RealSR is best for pictures (but it also works very well with more art-style images).
- Waifu2x is best for anime-style cover art.
- SRMD is also good for pictures but RealSR is often better.
